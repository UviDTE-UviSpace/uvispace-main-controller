UviSpace Main Controller
========================

The UviSpace Main Controller is part of the UviSpace project, a system for remotely
controlling Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) moving inside a delimited space and
observed by a network of FPGA-based camera devices.

This subsystem is in charge of obtaining camera data, processing it, and give the
proper movement orders to the vehicles.

The project is developed by a team of researchers at the *Electronic Technology
Department* in the `University of Vigo <http://uvigo.gal/uvigo_en/index.html>`_.
