"""
This module contains the Image class, for image processing operations.

The operations implemented in the class methods are focused to the 
images obtained from the external FPGAs in the UviSpace project. Thus, 
once obtained a grey scale image, this module provide functions for 
getting the shapes (triangles) in the image, and then their vertices. 
Prior to segment the image, a binarization has to be applied, as it 
eases the segmentation process. 

Important note
--------------

A point array is written by convention in the form 
*[row, column]*. In a cartesian system, the points are expressed
as *(x,y)*. Finally, in an image representation (viewer), the typical is 
to display points coordinates as  *(x', y')*. They equivalences are the 
following:

.. math::

 x = x' = column

 y = -y' = -row

Thus, special care has to be taken when dealing with operations in 
different scopes e.g. trigonometric operations will be handled with the 
cartesian values, while image operations are normally performed with the
array convention. Finally, when sending the array values to a viewer or 
to an external device, the image representation mentioned above is 
the typical used system.
