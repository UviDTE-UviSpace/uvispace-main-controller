"""Module for implementing a Kalman filter.

The Kalman filter is a well-known algorithm for improving the
localization of an object given measures of its position and a model of
its behaviour.

The algorithm is defined by two main stages, namely the state
prediction, that estimates the state (position) of the object given the
previous one and the value of the input variables; and the fusion with
the measurements, that filters the values obtained by the sensors and
the prediction calculated on the previous stage.
estimates the value that a sensor should obtain, given 
the state prediction.

    """Class for implementing a linear Kalman Filter.

    It contains two methods for implementing the two stages of the
    Kalman filter (predict and update), that should be run alternating
    each one.

    Besides, the noise distributions can be changed before the update
    stage, and the Kalman gain will vary accordingly.

        The matrices present in the algorithm's main formulas are the
        following:

        * F is the prediction matrix
        * B is the control matrix
        * P is the state covariance matrix
        * R is the measurement noise covariance matrix
        * Q is the process noise covariance matrix
        * K is the Kalman gain. The bigger it is, the more importance is
        given to the measurement, and less to the prediction.



        Algorithm workflow:
        -------------------

        * (optional) Before calling the prediction method, **update the
         process noise** (many processes have a constant process noise).
        * Once the previous iteration was finished, and known the time
         step until the next iteration, **call the predict method**,
          which will estimate the new position of the vehicle.
        * (optional) Before updating the filter with the input
         measurements, **update the measurement noise**. This is usually
         updated when there are detectable changes on the state of the
         sensors i.e. If GPS is being used and the vehicle enters a
         tunnel; or if any obstacle intercedes between an imaging sensor
         and the vehicle.
        * Once the measurements input is obtained, **call the update
         method**, that will merge the predicted position with the one
         given by the sensors.
