    It is intended to work with registers of an external FPGA. The 
    register identifiers must correspond with the ones of the
    HDL circuit implemented in the FPGA.
    
    Used methods from parent class:
    
    * connect((host, port)): connects to specified remote address
    * close(): close the socket opened with the client
    * send(data): send data to the client
    * recv(buflen): read the specified number of bytes
    * settimeout(timeout): time to wait for the client to respond

    :param int buffer_size: number of bytes of the incoming data.
    :param timeout: value, in seconds, of the time that will be waited 
     for reading incoming data. This will set the object to timeout mode
     (By default, it is set to blocking mode).
    :type timeout: int or float

    The class has 2 dictionaries, _REGISTERS and _COMMANDS, that contain
    all the valid commands that can be sent to the FPGA and the declared
    registers inside it. When interacting with the FPGA, can only be 
    accessed the commands and registers in these dictionaries.

    * *RED/GREEN/BLUE_THRESHOLD*: The pixel intensity thresholds for
